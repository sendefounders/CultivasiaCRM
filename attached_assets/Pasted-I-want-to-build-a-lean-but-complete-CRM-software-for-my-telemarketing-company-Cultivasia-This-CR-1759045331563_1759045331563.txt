I want to build a lean but complete CRM software for my telemarketing company (Cultivasia).
This CRM will manage telemarketing calls, upsells, transactions, and agent performance, with a Monday.com-inspired sidebar UI.

Please generate the backend + frontend (React/Next.js or Node/Express + Postgres preferred, but open to MERN).
Keep the MVP lean, but include the following:

🔐 Authentication & Roles
Custom username/password authentication (no 3rd party SSO for MVP).

Roles: Admin and Agent.

Admin can add Agents with username/password inside Setup tab.

Session-based or JWT auth (whichever is simpler in this stack).

📑 Sidebar Navigation (Monday.com inspired)
Tabs:

Dashboard

Call List

Transactions

Setup

Sidebar should be collapsible and responsive.

📞 Call Management
Call List Table columns: Date, Customer Name, Phone Number, Order, Current Price, Agent Assigned, Status, Call Button.

Filters: Date range, Call Type (Confirmation, Promo), Status, Agent.

Call Button behavior:

Opens Customer Info popup with details + call history.

Buttons: End Call, Unattended, Undo.

After “End Call”: Show Upsell Popup with:

Original order vs new product selection.

Price comparison.

Buttons: Upsell / Decline.

After Upsell/Decline → Call button greys out (locked).

Call status tracking: New, In Progress, Called, Unattended, Completed. Add timestamps.

💰 Transactions
Transactions tab updates real-time when upsells complete.

Audit trail for all upsells and call outcomes.

CSV Import (for Confirmation Calls + Promo Calls) with:

Auto-detection of columns: Date, Name, Order, Quantity, Address.

Preview + validation + error messages before final import.

Prevent duplicate imports.

Manual “Create Order” form.

📊 Dashboard Metrics
Sales charts (daily/weekly/monthly).

Upsell amount.

Conversion rates (Confirmation Calls vs Promo Calls).

Agent performance leaderboard.

Agent scorecards (calls handled, upsells closed, conversion rate).

⚙️ Setup Tab (Admin only)
Product management: SKU, Name, Price, Units, Active/Inactive toggle.

Agent management: Add/Remove agents, reset passwords.

Agent assignment logic:

Distribute new leads evenly across available agents.

Reassign if agent marked inactive.

🛠 Additional Features (Lean MVP)
CSV error handling with row highlighting.

Responsive design with Monday.com-style loading states + error messages.

Duplicate protection: check phone number + date.

Greyed-out call button after call outcome chosen.

Basic audit logs: who imported, who updated, timestamp.

Search bar across Call List + Transactions.

🔧 Stack Recommendation
Frontend: React (Next.js preferred), shadcn/ui for UI components, Recharts for charts.

Backend: Node/Express or Next.js API routes.

Database: Postgres (Prisma ORM).

Auth: JWT-based sessions.

File parsing: Papaparse or Fast-CSV.

Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase/Render (backend+db).

🎯 Output Required
Database schema (SQL or Prisma).

REST or GraphQL endpoints for: Auth, Calls, Transactions, Products, Agents.

Example seed data for testing.

Working CRUD UI for all tabs.

Minimal but clean styling (responsive).
